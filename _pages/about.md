Welcome
======

My name is Dr. Bradley N. Jack and I'm a Senior Lecturer and ARC DECRA Research Fellow in the Research School of Psychology at the Australian National University. I received my PhD from Southern Cross University and I received my postdoctoral training from UNSW Sydney.

Research
======

My research is in the field of cognitive neuroscience, and I am especially interested in how neural processes give rise to inner experiences, such as consciousness, inner speech, and sense of agency in the healthy, developing, and diseased brain. To investigate this, I combine behavioural and electrophysiological techniques, advanced signal analyses, computational modelling, and brain-computer interfaces.

Teaching
======

I teach a Special Topics in Psychology course called "An introduction to the event-related potential technique". The aim of this course is to introduce students to the essential aspects of the ERP technique, providing them with a solid foundation for conducting ERP research. If you're interested in this course, please contact me.

Supervision
======

I'm always interested in meeting with PhD, Honours, or undergraduate students who would like to conduct a research project in my laboratory. If you're interested in having me as your supervisor, please contact me.
